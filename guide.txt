# Emotion Recognition with Emoji Feedback

This script uses a combination of `cv2`, `DeepFace`, and `face_recognition` to detect facial emotions in real-time from webcam feed. Detected emotions are then mapped to corresponding emojis.

## Requirements:
- OpenCV (cv2)
- DeepFace
- face_recognition
- time
- emoji

## Getting Started:

1. Install Python:
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. If not, you can download it from the official Python website.

2. Ensure you have the required libraries installed:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python deepface face_recognition emoji

3. Install Homebrew (if not installed):
Homebrew is a package manager for macOS that makes it easier to install software.

4. Install dependencies needed by the libraries

5. By creating a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
This ensures that the libraries you install don't interfere with other Python projects you might have.

6. Install the required Python libraries.

Run the code:
Once all libraries are installed, you can run the emotionFace Python code.

How the Script Works:

Initializes webcam feed.
Continuously captures frames and detects faces.
Each detected face undergoes emotion analysis using DeepFace.
Detected emotions are mapped to their basic forms (e.g., 'happy' to 'Happiness').
Emotions are further mapped to their corresponding emojis.
Emotion results are displayed on the video feed and saved to a results list.
If the 'q' key is pressed or after a predefined duration, the script stops.
Results are saved to emotion_results.txt.

Modifying the Script:

To change the recognition duration, modify the DURATION variable.
Add more emotions or change emoji mappings in the map_to_emoji function.
If you'd like to add more sophisticated logging or feedback mechanisms, modify the end section where results are written to a file.
